# Evaluating the Effectiveness of Pet Adoption Videos

We are an animal NGO and we want to encourage pet adoption. To do this, we will show a video of animals to people. However, we do not know what is more effective: a video of dogs or a video of cats.

Therefore, we decided to run an experiment: we will create 2 videos, one of a dog and one of a cat. Then, we will ask people the probability that they will adopt an animal.

* The participants in this experiment will only see one video each.

* At the end of the video, we will ask them the probability that they will adopt an animal.

* The samples are random and without systematic biases.

**Objective**: To evaluate which animal (dog or cat) should be featured in an adoption campaign video.

**Experiment**: 500 people who do not have pets will watch the adoption campaign videos. The videos are identical except for the animals shown:

- 250 people will be randomized to the cat video.
- 250 people will be randomized to the dog video.

**Response**: "What is the chance of adopting a pet? (0-100)" after the video.

Is the average probability of those who watch the cat video equal to those who watch the dog video?
